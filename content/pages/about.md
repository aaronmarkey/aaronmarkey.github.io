title: About

👋 Hey,

I'm just some person attempting to educate myself — really that's about it. I'm interested in philosophy, specifically
society's relationship with work and my relationship with happiness. I spend my time reading, mostly
fantasy/sci-fi and psychology books.

I've a Masters of Science in Computer Science from Northern Illinois University and have spent more than a decade in
the New York start-up scene. I'm a software developer with experience in the cannabis, digital advertising, and
aviation industries.

At some point I moved to Colorado and realized I'm more interested in books than technology, in writing fiction than
writing code.
