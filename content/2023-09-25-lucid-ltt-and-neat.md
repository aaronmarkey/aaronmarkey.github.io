Few things can inspire in a world of commodity and "value". Here's some of those things.


## A Screwdriver

Three years and every detail is perfect. Great weight distribution, a satisfying bit holder mechanism, and an absolutely perfectly pitched ratchet mechanism.

## An Electric Car

Yes, a Lucid Air Sapphire is an astronomical $250,000. Mark and Jack dissect every part of this car and it's engineering. Love is still in the American auto industry. It's just hard to find.

## A Box Cutter

This isn't out yet (and it's a Kickstarter, so who knows), but it looks to be everything one would want in a perfect box cutter. A $99 box cutter begs us to examine our relationship with commodity items. I worked at a box store for ~four years. And lost countless box cutters. Probably because I didn't think anything of them.
