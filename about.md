👋 Hey-o internet,

I'm aaron markey, some person in NYC. Hot takes, serial project abandoner, ⌨️ mechanical keyboards, and ⬢ Titan main. Professionally, I write software.

Feel free to email me at <{{ site.author.email }}>.
I'll try to respond as quickly as possible, but stuff can slip through
the cracks. If I don't respond, try [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}).
